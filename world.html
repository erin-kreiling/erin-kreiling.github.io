			<h1>How have the types of terrorist attacks changed over time and by country?</h1>
			<p>
			As the world has changed and evolved over time, so have the types of terrorist attacks
			we see occurring. The visualizations below display these trends around the world. The first map show
			the total number of terrorist attacks (of any type) in each country in 2017. The color scale indicates the
			volume of attacks but you can also hover over the map to see the specific number of attacks. Pakistan had
			by far the worst scenario in 2017, with over 12,000 attacks. For comparison, the United States had 599 and
			Canada only had 12. Countries with no value displaying, such as Greenland, saw no terrorist attacks 
			whatsoever in 2017.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Terrorist Attacks by Country in 2017</h2>
				<div id="attacks2017_div"
				 style="width:900px; height:500px;"></div>
			<p>
			The second map shows the total number killed by country in 2017. You'll remember from the above map that
			Pakistan had the highest number of attacks, however, the highest number of people were killed in Iraq (24,515).
			This was about double those killed in Pakistan (12,833). Coincidentally, the number of people killed in the
			United States was the same as the number of attacks (599). This is due to the fact that the majority of attacks
			saw one or zero people killed.			
			</p>
		 
			<h2>Total Killed by Country in 1997-2017</h2>
				<div id="totalkilled_div"
				style="width:900px; height:500px;"></div>
				
			<p>
			The third map focuses on those killed in shooting events from 1997-2017 by country. Similar to the previous two
			maps, the volumes are quite high in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Relative to many of the countries of the world,
			the United States had a rather low volume of shootings (87), but this volume is striking compared to the majority
			of the other developed countries around the world. The <strong>Terror in the U.S.</strong> page will dig in to this
			phenomenon further. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Number of Shooting Events by Country in 1997-2017</h2>
				<div id="totalshootings_div"
				style="width:900px; height:500px;"></div>
			This table allows you to sort in ascending or descending order to view each type by the country that had the most
			(or least) occurrences. Once again, Pakistan and Iraq have the highest volumes for the first three attack types 
			(Armed Assault, Assassination, and Bombing/Explosion). After that, India shows up as the first or second highest in the 
			other categories. 
			<h2>Number of Attacks by Type and Country</h2>
				<div id="attackstype_div"
				style="width:900px; height:500px;"></div>
			
			<p>
			The final visualization on this page shows the dramatic increase in terrorist attacks worldwide. For this particular chart,
			the data is not broken out by country but paints a dismal picture for the ways the world is changing. The data point in 2014
			is especially terrible, which prompts the question: what happened in 2014? When researching this year, the first article that
			appears on Google is entitled "Terror attacks, deaths up sharply in 2014: State Department " and you'll read on to learn that
			al Qaeda was the leading jihadist militant group during this year. There was a 35% increase in attacks from 2013 and the increase
			occurred primarily in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (Strobel, 2015). </strong>.
