				<h1>How have terrorist attacks changed over time and around the world?</h1>
			
				<p>
				According to the Global Terrorism Index produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, 
				there has been a 44 percent decrease in those killed in acts of terrorism globally in the 
				last three years. However, this statistic might surprise those of us who have been watching 
				the news. For example, 2018 began with seventeen students being killed in a shooting at 
				Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Less publicized but even more fatal was a 
				suicide bombing in Aleppo, Syria, in April 2017 that killed more than 126 people. Finally,
				2016 saw a truck attack in Nice that killed 84, a shooting/bombing in Istanbul that killed 44,
				a shooting in Orlando that killed 49, and a bombing in Baghdad that killed 292. These attacks 
				are unfortunately just a sample of the many that have occurred over the last few years. The 
				question now is are these attacks truly decreasing over the long term or is this a temporary 
				trend marred by highly publicized, highly fatal attacks?  
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The analysis on this website focuses on three main questions about trends in terrorism:
				<ul>
				<li>How have the types of terrorist attacks changed over time and by country?</li>
				<li>Do the types of weapons used in these attacks vary ?</li>
				<li>Are there substantially more mass shootings in the United States than other parts of the world?</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You may ask, what makes an event a terrorist attack? The University of Maryland publishes 3 criteria
				for being classified as an act of terrorism: 
				<ol>
				<li>"The incident must be intentional."</li>
				<li>"The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence."</li>
				<li>"The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors."</li>
				</ol>
				If all three of these are met, then the event is classified as a terrorist attack and is included in the
				Global Terrorism Database.
