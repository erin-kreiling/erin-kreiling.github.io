				The University of Maryland maintains an extensive database, called the Global Terrorism Database,
				that details any and all terrorist events
				from 1970-2017. Within the database, there is information 
				on more than 180,000 terrorist attacks with a variety of different factors, such as Date, Region,
				Country, Perpetrator Group, Weapon Type, Attack Type, and Target Type. The data for each of the attacks 
				collected from more than 4 million news articles and 25,000 other news sources. Citation information 
				for the database can be found at the bottom of the page.

				<p><strong>Data Preparation and Preliminary Analysis</strong>
				The initial data mining for this project was completed within RStudio. After downloading .csv files from 
				the University of Maryland Global Terrorism Database, each was loaded into RStudio then concatenated to 
				form one large .csv file with the appropriate variables and years included. The larger dataset was then 
				analyzed to ensure proper variable types and identify any missing values. The Codebook provided by the 
				database was utilized extensively during the data mining and cleaning portion of the project.
				The majority of the cleaning for this project took place within Excel, working with pivot tables to filter
				the data into the necessary subsets, as well as filling in a minor number of missing values. Some of the data
				was loaded into Google Sheets, in order to make use of the Google Charts API. However, because the data coming
				from the University database was so clean, minimal data munging was necessary and the focus was primarily on 
				developing the visualizations nad this website.
